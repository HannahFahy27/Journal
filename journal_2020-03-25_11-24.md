## Takeaways

- I learned that Thoreau was a kind of vegetarian! 
- I learned that I'm very unmotivated when there are no real classes
- My cat really loves social distancing, he is thriving, he is also sitting on my arm, so I have to type one handed
- I'm still not a Thoreau fan, but I appreciate ornithology which is a miracle because I used to think that was a joke
- This semester I was really trying to push myself for a 4.0 (it's not as crazy as it sounds because I loved all my classes). However, now I'm worried that I won't do as well because I'm really bad at getting things done without real classes.
- I could relate almost all of Walden to the current events. I've been doing this in all of my classes! I highly recommend *Deaf Republic* by Ilya Kaminsky, but I was unable to read it without thinking of this pandemic.

## Random Things

- I got into graduate school today! I'll be at Geneseo one more year while I get my masters of science in teaching English to adolescents.
- I've been writing a lot of poetry (I'm in Engl 301 and Engl 202 so that's unsurprising), but I wonder how I could mix poetry with digital technology. Someone in my class wrote a poem that had all the colors replaced with their code (red = #FF0000, etc) which was so cool! I wonder where I could take poetry if I mixed it with coding. I'm going to keep thinking of this. In the past I took Doggett's class on Yeats and digital literature, but I'd want to be more creative than just a new way to experience things that are already written or annotating a poem like we did in that class. I'd really like to create a piece that can't be read without the digital aspect. Professor Lytton Smith has it in my head that I need to write a chapbook, so that's all I've been able to think about.
