## Free Speech and the Media

### Markdown

**What I learned?**

 - Free speech vs hate speech is a legal nightmare
 - No one remembers lectures years later, they remember different aspects of college
 - Virginia vs Black
    - Burning crosses on someone's lawn is a hate crime
    - Action vs expression
    - When a cross is burned with bias motivation, it's hate speech
    - You cannot assume bias intent 
    - KKK can burn a cross because that is "expressing their views" 
 - O'Brien
    - Burnt his draft card
    - Court decided draft card burning was conduct while flag burning was speech 
 - You can't put an antisemitic poster on one person's door, but you can put it on every person's door
 - Difficult to protect expression and safety 
 - Where should we limit expression?
    - After knowing the intent
