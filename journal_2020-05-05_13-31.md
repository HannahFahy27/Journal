## Thoughts
- I went on a six mile walk with my niece on Sunday because it was so beautiful out and poor Ava is going mad sitting inside (6 year olds aren't built for quarantine). We walked from her house to her old house, and the most enjoyable part was the beautiful little bridge. Ava and I saw a huge snapping turtle and so many dogs! 
- I tried to write three comments in *Walden* today, but I only ended up writing one because I spent a lot of energy on that one and I'm very proud of it. I think I could've written a whole blog post on solitude (the chapter and the concept), but in COVID-19 times, I don't know how to do things. I used to be able to do a million tasks a day with 0 time! Now I have all of the time, and I can't do anything!
- I've been enjoying coding for the final project. When I juggle, I get into a "flow" state, and I think I have been getting into a flow state with coding. Flow is nice because you are completely focused on one thing in that moment. It's a challenging task, but not so much so that you get frustrated. 
- I'm exhausted. I don't know what else to say in this journal.
