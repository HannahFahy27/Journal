## Takeaways

- Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address" is a fluid text
- I'd like to know more about each version, I see on the versioning machine a little explanation of each wittness, but I would like to really know the specifics
- I'm really nervous to make the timeline, that stresses me out a lot because it's a new assignment, and I have no idea how to use the TimelineJS program
- I still don't understand what we are doing in this class
- I am also nervous for the blog post, I don't see English much differently
- I'm working on a chapbook of poems in my other class, I think I will try to include a "coding" poem(no promises though, I have a ridiculous amount of work to do, I will try to get around to writing it), so I guess there is that. I can see coding as a language that can work together with English to create new meaning???? Does that count????
- Why did every professor add a billion assignments????
- I'm not really sure what I should be writing in these journals, but I'm really hoping this all counts
- Oh wait I did teach myself something!!!!! I couldn't figure out why some of my photos uploaded to github and others didn't, so I messed around with everything, until i figured out that I have to be updating my "Images" folder in github each time I have a new image to upload in a journal. That was exciting (and frustrating) to figure out
- I also learned that you have to be SO EXACT! One of my pictures wasn't working because the image was saved with .PNG in capitals, and I was writing it in lowercase
