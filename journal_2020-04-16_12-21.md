## Ideas for Post on How ENGL 340 Changed the Way I See English 
-  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Coding is hard
- I don't like fluid texts because I don't think that's how the author wanted us to read their work
- What was the point of *The Informtation*? I read that whole book, and I still have no idea why is was assigned in this class, informtation exists and is growing? I don't see how it applies
- Still don't know what digital humanities is
- Coronavirus sucks? 
- Should I have been using Jupyter Notebook? Still don't understand why I had to download that 
- Voyager is sort of cool? I don't know how much actual application it has. Some words get used more than others? 
- Using git bash makes me feel like a hacker in a movie, but also what is the point of it? I can get to my folders by clicking on them? I can open a new file by... clicking on the button that opens... a new file? I only use it to upload journals to git hub, what does git hub have to do with English?
- A wild idea appears: git hub is a tool for analyzing language, just not the English language. It's for the language of coding. We use a lot of the same skills for reading through code as we do for analyzing a text? Does that make any sense? You have to close read code the way you close read text. In text, the blue curtains reference a character's depression, there are symbols in code too. It takes similar skills because someone who doesn't understand color symbolism will miss the underlying meaning while someone who doesn't understand symbols in code will also miss things. I wrote the shrug face at the beginning of this journal as a joke, but I knew that I would need an extra slash in the plain text in order for a single slash to appear in the preview text. I don't know why that is to be honest, but from moderating reddit servers, I know that certain symbols have jobs and to cancel out the job of the slash, I need an extra one. Two slashes will equal one slash. I'm not literate enough in code to know why, but I am literate enough to know that it's needed. I don't think I'm actually literate enough in code to execute this idea properly to be honest. It's like when I show a poem to my mom. She appreciates how pretty the language is, but she misses a lot of the deeper meaning. This isn't because she's not smart (she is very smart). I see the deeper meaning because I'm an English major. Knowing literary symbols and techniques is kind of my thing! Meanwhile, my mom's highest level of school is her GED. She's smart in a different way than I am. She is an expert at scheduling because she's spent the last 17 years as a scheduler for a company. She can look at a list of requested days off, call outs, breaks, etc and make a comprehensive and effieicent schedule. I have no idea how she does it! It's the same when I look at code. I only have a superficial understanding of it. I appreciate how complex it is, but I don't understand how it works and what each symbol means. 


### Who Knew an Joke Would Actually Give me an Idea?
