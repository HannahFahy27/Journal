## Blog Post 

- I am first and foremost an educator. I had so much fun writing the last blog post because I was able to bring in my passion. I'm still not sure how I managed to connect African drums to architecture to education to eBooks to digital humanities or why in the world I was able to get away with that craziness. Nevertheless, I spent hours working on that blog post, not because it was hard, but beacuse I was having so much fun that I wanted to make it perfect. If it isn't broke, don't fix it. I'm going to go at this as an educator again. That's where my strengths lie. 
- I'm bad at math -> a lot of people are bad at math, not b/c they are naturally bad at math -> they don't understand the language of math -> math is a literacy -> all school subjects are a literacy -> somehow I never noticed that coding is a literacy until this class that forced me to have the two side to side -> if you don't believe me just look at code poetry
- English is the what we all think about when we think of literacy, not math or coding, but there are so many different types of literacy! 




### Good News! 

I have been trying to share good news every single synchronus class I have, and my classmates and professors have been telling me that it helps them some. We don't do have classes together for digital lit anymore, so I'll just share some good news in my journal.

- I got into grad school at SUNY Geneseo! 
- I was offered the position of LIVES Program Graduate Assisstant!
- I'm being published in this semester's edition of Gandy Dancer! 
- I'm rank 16 on AdVenture Capitalist which is an idle clicker game I play in the background of all my classes!
- I've been playing League of Legends again, I haven't played since high school, and I forgot how much I loved it!
- I have new neighbors, and while I haven't met them yet (social distancing), I can see them starting a really nice garden from my window!
