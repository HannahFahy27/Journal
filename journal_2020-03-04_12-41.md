## What I Learned Today

- How to find long words in a text in voyant
- The shortest sentence in *Walden* is "Furniture." 
- Jupyter Notebook can combine text and code so you can write yourself notes
- / to divide, * to multiple, ** to square in python 
- capitalization and parenthesis matter in python! 

## Types in python 
- type(1) = int (integer)
- type(1.0) = float (numbers with decimals)
- type(True) = bool (boolian) logic, true/false 
- type([1, 2, 3]) = list

## Variables in python 
- x = 5 (will make x = 5 for the rest of your thing)
- same deal with y = "hello"
