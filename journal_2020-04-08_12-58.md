## Notes

- Made a timeline for The Information https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=10DZWApmW4U4AkUPj8dOdOfCGSCptYHasgPR07geaktk&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650
- Need to make another timeline for Walden manuscript
- I've been wokring on a TimelineJS for the history of Safe Zone at Geneseo. I'm a Safe Zone trainer and intern, this is my project for this semester. I spent pre-spring break working on interviews for this project with fellow-intern Alyssa. Now that we are all online, Alyssa and I are compiling all the information into a timeline. I'm not sure TimelineJS is big enough for us to use though. We are having issues getting more than 15 slides. It looks really great so far though! 
- TimelineJS is really user friendly! I found it really easy to work with the program
